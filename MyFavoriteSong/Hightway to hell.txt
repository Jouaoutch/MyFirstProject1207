Livin' easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Askin' nothin', leave me be
Takin' everything in my stride

Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around

Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playin' in a rocking band
Hey momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land, wow

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Mm, don't stop me
Eh-woo

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell

Highway to hell (I'm on the highway to hell)
Highway to hell (highway to hell)
Highway to hell (I'm on the highway to hell)
Highway to hell

And I'm goin' down
All the way, wow
On the highway to hell
