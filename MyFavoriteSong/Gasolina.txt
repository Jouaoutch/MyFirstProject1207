[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Who's this? Da-ddy Yan-kee

[Pre-Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
I start the mambo so my chicks turn on the engines
I start the mambo so my chicks turn on the engines
I start the mambo so my chicks turn on the engines
So that they prepare for what's going to hit them
(Hard) Mami, I know that you won't leave me
(Hard) What I like is that you let yourself go
(Hard) Every weekend, she goes out to have fun
(Hard) My chick doesn't stop hanging out, 'cause

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Glory]
She likes the gasoline
Give me more gasoline
She loves the gasoline
Give mе more gasoline
She likеs the gasoline
Give me more gasoline
She loves the gasoline
Give me more gasoline

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
She turns on the turbines, she doesn't discriminate
She doesn't miss even the smallest parties
She gets all dressed up even to go to the street corner
She looks so good that even her shadow matches her
Murderer, she dominates me
She hangs out in cars, motorboats and limousines
She fills up her tank with adrenaline
When she hears reggeaton on the speakers
